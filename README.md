# Mechacar Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview of the Analysis
#### This project was conducted to help the manufacturing team at AutosRUs overcome production troubles with their new prototype, the **MechaCar**.
* The goal of this project was to:
    * Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes
    * Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from three different manufacturing lots
    * Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
    * Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Using the **R** Programming Language, a code was written to perform linear regression comparing the vehicles fuel effiency (MPG) based on five factors:  vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and the drive configuration (AWD, "yes" or "no").
